# distortion_correction

Matlab implementation for image distortion correction as described in the following publication:

Koolstra, K., O’Reilly, T., Börnert, P., & Webb, A. (2021). Image distortion correction for MRI in low field permanent magnet systems with strong B 0 inhomogeneity and gradient field nonlinearities. Magnetic Resonance Materials in Physics, Biology and Medicine, 1-12, doi: 10.1007/s10334-021-00907-2.

The main script reconstructs the tube phantom image as in Figure 4 of the paper. 

It would be great if you could cite this paper when you use the code.

Current reconstruction code only supports single slice reconstruction for 3D acquisitions.
